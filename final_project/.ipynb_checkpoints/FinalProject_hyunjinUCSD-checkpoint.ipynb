    "In this project, I wanted to figure out what people like and hate about San Diego Park & Recreation and answer the question on \"what should the city of San Diego do in the next five years?\". For the dataset, I used yelp data which contains both rating reviews and text reviews. To analyze the data, I cleaned the data, by removing the places unrelated to park from the dataset and used TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW) approach. "

    "One of the biggest American media company U.S.News & World Report stated visiting Balboa Park as the first best thing to do in San Diego and visiting Mission Beach as the second best thing to do in San Diego (link in the first reference). Since many people see this and visit the parks in San Diego, recognizing what people do like and dislike about the San Diego park is crucial to make people revisit the beautiful parks in San Diego. This is one of the reasons I decided to look for what people like and dislike about the parks and recreation places in San Diego. \n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy visiting parks in San Diego, especially the Balboa Park, on weekends. However, every experiences visiting the parks in San Diego are different. Some experiences are considered to be good when I readily found a parking spot and when I easily found the resting area. However, some experiences are considered to be bad when I was not able to find the resting area when I felt tired. On the internet, such as yelp website (link in the second reference), I could easily find reviews with high ratings on Balboa Park, but also I could find the reviews with low ratings on Balboa Park. So, I decided to find out what are the things that people do like and dislike about San Diego's park and recreation places. Also, I decided this research question since San Diego imporves what people dislike about the park and the recreation places, more people will revisit the city of San Diego\n",
